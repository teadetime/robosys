## Part of this course was building different actuators.
- Fiber Reinforced actuators (Ribbon wrapped Silicon Actuator)
- Pneunets


### Fiber reinforce actuators
To fabricate these actuators we made heavy use of [https://softroboticstoolkit.com/book/fiber-reinforced-bending-actuators](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/book/fiber-reinforced-bending-actuators)

The goal of this was a proof of concept actuator. I followed the proof of concept on the site fairly accurately.

I made a mold that was ~1" wide and 6" long. It had a central block that was .5" by 5". This was the section that is inflated.
